Flutter test for Crédit Agricole

## TODO

This test is a tiny bank application.

This app will have 2 screens:
- Display of the bank accounts list
- By choosing an account, display the account's operations list in a new screen

The rules are as follow:
- separate bank accounts types (Crédit Agricole and the reste)
- the "bank account"'s cell is expandable 
- display Crédit Agricole accounts in the first section then the rest in the second section
- accounts are sorted alphabetically
- while expanding a bank, display the accounts list
- the operation list is sorted by date(the newest on top of the list)
- if two operations have the same date sort them alphabetically
- on the account's operations list screen we can navigate back to the previews screen
